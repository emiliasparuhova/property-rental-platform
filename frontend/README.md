to develop a platform for the rental market that is more practical, accessible, and user-friendly.

process for tenants. It allows them to filter and view property listings based on specific criteria, making it 
easier to find properties that match their preferences.

platform, including creating, viewing, and deleting listings. This simplifies the process of offering 
properties for rent
